- What is JavaScript?
	- High level, interpreted programming language
	- Conforms to the ECMAScript specification
	- Multi-paradigm
	- Runs on the client/browser as well as on the server (Node.js)
	- dynamically typed
	- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It is basically JavaScript with some added features and static typing is one of those features

- Why learn JavaScript?
	- It is the programming language of the browser
	- Build very interactive user interfaces with frameworks like React
	- Used in building very fast server side and full stack applications
	- Used in mobile development (React Native, NativeScript, Ionic)
	- Used in desktop application development (Electron JS)

- What you will learn in this course?
	- Variables and Data Types
	- Arrays
	- Object Literals
	- Methods for strings, arrays, objects, etc
	- Loops - for, while, for...of, forEach, map
	- Conditionals (if, ternary and switch)
	- Functions (normal and arrow)
	- OOP (prototypes and classes)
	- DOM Selection
	- DOM manipulation
	- Events
	- Basic Form Validation

- Script tag
	- add script tag at the end in the body just before the ending body tag
	- so that html and css loads first
	- one can write JavaScript inside the script tag directly or write JavaScript in a separate file and link it to a script tag

- alert() function
	- shows a pop-up message in the browser window

- MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) platform
	- provides documentation for different technologies including JavaScript

- LOGGING OUTPUT
	- console.log('message');
	- console.error('message');
	- console.warn('message');

- VARIABLES
	- var, let, const
	- var makes a variable globally scoped
	- let and const have a block-level scope

- DATA TYPES
	- String
	- Numbers
	- Boolean
	- null
	- undefined
	- Symbol

- STRINGS AND STRING METHODS
	- Concatenation
	- Template String/Literal: use backticks ``
	- length property
	- toUpperCase() method
	- toLowerCase() method
	- substring() method
	- split() method

- COMMENTS
	- // for single line comment
	- /**/ for multi-line comment

- ARRAYS - variables that hold multiple values
	- can store heterogeneous data
	- dynamically allocated
	- no fixed size
	- data can be added or removed
	- push method
	- unshift method
	- pop method
	- Array.isArray() method
	- indexOf() method

- OBJECT LITERALS: key-value pairs
	- destructuring

- ARRAYS OF OBJECTS AND JSON
	- JSON is a format used to send data to a server or receive data from a server
	- JSON.stringify() method

- LOOPS
	- for loop
	- while loop
	- For...of Loop

- HIGH ORDER ARRAY METHODS (show prototype)
	- forEach() - Loops through array
	- map() - Loop through and create new array
	- filter() - Returns array based on condition

- CONDITIONALS
	- == matches values only and not datatypes
	- === matches values as well as datatypes
	- Simple If/Else Statement
	- Switch
	- Ternary operator / Shorthand if

- FUNCTIONS

- ARROW FUNCTIONS: short way of defining a function

- OOP
	- ES5
		- Constructor Function
		- Prototype: used to add methods
	- Built in constructors
	- ES6 Classes
		- do not require prototype to add methods
		- methods can be added directly

- ELEMENT SELECTORS
	- Single Element Selectors
	- Multiple Element Selectors

- MANIPULATING THE DOM

- EVENTS
	- Mouse Event: include click, mouseover, mouseout
	- Keyboard Event: include input

- USER FORM SCRIPT EXAMPLE
